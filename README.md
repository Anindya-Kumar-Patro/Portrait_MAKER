## Portrait_MAKER
This is an OPEN_CV project where you can easily convert your image into pencil sketches. 
Literally its very very simple with 3 lines of CODE
1) convert image to grayscale
2) Use Gaussian Blur to blur the image
3) Convert it into negative
4) merge the Gaussian and negative image to get the sketch
